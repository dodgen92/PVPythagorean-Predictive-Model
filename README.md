# PVPythagorean-Predictive-Model
A testing tool concept for balancing competitive video games

** Overview **

A major obstacle faced in competitive gaming is balance. Certain characters/classes can become obsolete because they're outclassed by others. Normally balance changes are made retroactively based on user feedback and live data win percentage (Even though historical win percentage isn't necessarily the best indicator of future performance). Adjusting the concept of baseball statistician Bill James' pythagorean expectancy to game testing can allow for a more balanced product upon release and re-allocate development resources that would normally be focused on nerfs/buffs.


** Example model **
The following is tailored for World of Warcraft arena. Please note the model will require adjustments through playtesting to acheive the lowest possible mean absolute deviation, particularly the dispel factorial and the exponent of R. Though I have used a similar one to the demo to success in selecting arena partners (6x Elite achievements, a version of the model was used in each selection)
