# PVPythagorean-Predictive-Model
A testing tool concept for balancing competitive video games

** Overview **

A major obstacle faced in competitive gaming is balance. Certain characters/classes can become obsolete because they're outclassed by others. Normally balance changes are made retroactively based on user feedback and live data win percentage (Even though historical win percentage isn't necessarily the best indicator of future performance). Adjusting the concept of baseball statistician Bill James' pythagorean expectancy to game testing can allow for a more balanced product upon release and re-allocate development resources that would normally be focused on nerfs/buffs.
